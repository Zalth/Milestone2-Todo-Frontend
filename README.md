# TODO MERN Stack Project

## Inspiration
Whenever we start a collaborative coding project we create a Todo list. A Todo List allows us to delegate individual tasks to group members. By doing so, we are able to stay on track with the progress of our project. 

## How to Use
 The default page loads on Todos sorted by Due Dates in the following catergories: Past Due, Due Today, Due Tomorrow, Due Within the Next 7 Days, and Future Due Dates. Each Todo shows up under the appropriate catergory with buttons to edit the Todo or to delete the Todo. The Edit button opens up a detailed Todo view form, pulling in the data of the Todo and allowing you to make any changes you would like. Clicking on a Todo expands the Todo's information. At the bottom of the page, there is a simple form to create a new Todo with only the required information: The Name of the Todo, The Priority, and The Due Date. 

A new detailed Todo can be created by clicking on the 'New Task' Link in the NavMenu. It includes the required fields and an optional field : Description of the Todo.

A Dropdown Menu in the NavMenu gives the user the option to either sort by Priority or Due Date of the Todo List. The Priority catergories are: Critical, High, Medium, and Low. 

### Technologies Used
Project was bootstraped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Node.js
React
MongoDB
Bootstrap
Axios
Express

### Outstanding Bugs
Display doesn't refresh after deleting a Todo.

### Proposed Future Functionality
Refreshing after deleting a Todo.
Implementing a User Login
Sub-Tasks
Adding the following fields: Estimated Work Time, Status( not started, in progress, etc. )

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
